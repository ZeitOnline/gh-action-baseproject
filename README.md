# ZEIT ONLINE Terraform ``baseproject``connector

**_NOTE:_** This Action is used internally by the ZEIT ONLINE organization and is probably not useful outside of this specific context.

## Summary

This composite action fetches environment-specific infrastructure infos from a [Terraform baseproject](https://github.com/ZeitOnline/terraform-modules-baseproject) instance. Its main purpose is to facilitate standardized, secure (i.e. keyless) Authentication against ZON Cloud infrastructure, such as GCE, GKE, GCR and Vault.


## Example Usage


### Authenticate against GKE and GAR

Set up authentication against the Cluster that is configured for the project-environment.
Also authenticate against GAR. All following steps will be fully authenticated to K8s/GAR.

```yaml
jobs:
    build:
        # ...
        steps:
            # ...
            - name: Baseproject
              uses: ZeitOnline/gh-action-baseproject@v0
              with:
                project_name: ${{ env.PROJECT }}
                environment: ${{ env.ENVIRONMENT }}
                gke_auth: true
                gar_docker_auth: true
            # ...
```

### Fetch secrets from Vault

The `gh-action-baseproject` Action outputs all information neccessary for authenticating against Vault with the
`jwt` auth method:

```yaml
jobs:
    build:
        # ...
        steps:
            - name: Baseproject
              uses: ZeitOnline/gh-action-baseproject@v0
              with:
                project_name: ${{ env.PROJECT }}
                environment: ${{ env.ENVIRONMENT }}

            - name: Retrieve secrets from Vault
              id: vault-secrets
              uses: hashicorp/vault-action@v2.4.0
              with:
                method: jwt
                url: ${{ steps.baseproject.outputs.vault_addr }}
                path: ${{ steps.baseproject.outputs.gha_vault_path }}
                role: ${{ steps.baseproject.outputs.gha_vault_role }}
                secrets: |
                  zon/v1/path/to/my-secret my-secret;

            - name: Use Vault secret
              run: echo ${{ steps.vault-secrets.outputs.my-secret }}
```


### Set up docker buildx

For both convenience and consistency this action can also set up a `docker buildx` builder.

This behaviour is controlled by the `setup_buildx` input, which defaults to "do nothing";
set it to "true" to enable.
Setting `gar_docker_auth` also enables this implicitly
(with the assumption, if you want to push a docker image, you probably want to build one first),
if this is not desired, set `setup_buildx` to "false" explicitly.
